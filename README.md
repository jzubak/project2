Hygge At Home is a 'style-box' style app that allows our users to log in, take a short test, and discover the perfect furniture for their homes.  Hygge At Home utilizes the following technologies: MySQL, Sequelize, bCrypt, Passport.js, Express, Express Sessions, Node.js, Handlebars, and the Etsy API.

The experience begins when you select to `Signin` or `Signup` on the landing page.

When the user enters their information into the fields and clicks `signup` the password is encrypted using `bCrypt` and saved into our `Users` table.  This table comes into play later in our app when we need to save results from the tests for a specific user, and display that stored information in our members section.

`Passport.js` then authenticates the user with a local strategy, and brings them to the beginning of our test.

At this point our user is asked 8 questions. For each question we provide 4 answers that can be chosen from, each with a different numerical value.  The images are always presented in a different order thanks to this shuffle function.

At the end of the test the numeric values from the 8 answers are stored in another table, and we use a short bit of logic to determine which style furniture best fits your style

At this point an API call is made to `Etsy` with the style selected from the test, and we use jQuerey to display the results.

In addition to displaying your style, 12 items with images, descriptions, and prices are also shown.  Each one of these pictures is a clickable link that will bring you to the Etsy product page.

At this point the url for both the images, and the product postings are saved in a seperate table.  If you click on your name in the `navbar` you're taken to a members page where you can review the results from previously taken quizzes.  You can also click on `Take Another Quiz` in the top right corner to try again, and get matched with new products for your home!
